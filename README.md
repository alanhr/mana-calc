# Mana calculator

Hi! I'm a newbie Magic the Gathering player and one of my friends teached me how to find how many land cards I should have on my deck based on my magic cards, it's a repetitive task, so I made a program to automate the calculation.

## How to use it

Just download it, you should be fine =)

## How to develop

You must have node.js installed. Clone the repo and run "npm install" to install the dependencies, please change the .js files used.
